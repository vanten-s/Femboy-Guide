# Definition

Blåhaj is a beautiful plush toy made and sold by IKEA. 

# Culture
It is a symbol of the trans community because of its similiar colors to the trans flag.
As a femboy it's a must-have because it's so cute and squishable.
Blåhaj is very common in memes on for example Tiktok, Reddit and Twitter.
