## Usage
It's most common among Arch Linux and Gentoo users altough anyone can use them. First step is to put them on. Secondly boot up a terminal. If you don't already have a project you can create one by typing 
```bash
cargo new
```
and it will ask you for the name of your project. When you have your project the last step is to start coding!
